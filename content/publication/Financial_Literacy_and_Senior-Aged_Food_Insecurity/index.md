abstract: "Food insecurity remains one of the most significant public health concerns in the United States today with this being particularly true for the senior population. Using original survey data collected in Clark County, NV, we investigate the link between financial literacy and senior food security relying on perceived parental financial confidence as an exclusion restriction. Our results indicate that financial literacy broadly, and financial behaviors specifically, can play a critical role in lessening the propensity for a senior household to be classified as food insecure."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We study the causal effect of financial literacy on food insecurity for the senior population using original survey data collect in Clark County Nevada.
