## Course Evaluations

For the full course evaluations, click here: <a href="/ECON_418-518_Course_Evaluations/ECON_418-518_Course_Evaluations.pdf" target="_blank">Course Evaluations</a>. Here are selected student evaluations:

1. I started this course in tears, but it ended up becoming one of my favorite classes! It wouldn't have been possible without the professor's support.
2. I have never had an instructor grade as quickly or have as much availability to assist students outside of class. Will replied via Slack incredibly fast and always addressed concerns/questions in-class, via D2L announcements, and slack. All the materials were super well organized, and the syllabus and class schedule was actually true to the class. Deadlines and expectations were very clear.
3. Great instructor that genuinely knows and cares about the material and his students.
4. Brasic has a lot of promise to become a very strong lecturer and already demonstrates his potential as an academic and professional.
5. Will is a competent and professional instructor. The course was challenging, but rewarding.
6. Will was a great professor. Appreciated his lectures.
7. I liked how there were so many practical aspects to this course. It is definitely something I brag about to recruiters.
8. I liked the difficulty of the class. This was the hardest class I have taken, but the most interesting and relevant to the industry in which I want to pursue a career. The professor was also very understanding and flexible and helped us learn the content in the best way possible.
9. I thought that it was a very challenging course that is very applicable to the real world and that was appreciated.
10. The professor had a very helpful nature and kind attitude that helped foster a fantastic learning environment.
11. The professor wasn't afraid to dive deeper into the math which was very beneficial.
12. Will Brasic was a good teacher. He was willing to adapt and change parts of the course as it was happening, such as changing the format of the final exam.
13. I really enjoyed how much practice and engagement with the material I was given in the course. I was acclimatized to course content and a lot of the learning.
14. He was a very nice grader and truly tried to get you to understand the content.
15. Really enjoyed the class & feel that it gave me some valuable skills.

## Welcome!

This is the course website for **Introduction to Econometrics: ECON 418-518.001** at **The University of Arizona** in-person during the **Fall 2024** semester. Here, you will be able to access the **lecture slides**, **homeworks**, and **exams** for the entire course along with **R code** used to teach the language. For the syllabus, click here: <a href="/ECON_418-518_Syllabus/ECON_418-518_Syllabus_1.pdf" target="_blank">Syllabus</a>.

This course will provide you with a comprehensive introduction to **econometrics**, a crucial tool for identifying causal effects. We will start by understanding the basics of econometrics and reviewing the essential mathematical concepts necessary for success in this course. Following this, we will delve into the fundamental building blocks of econometrics, focusing on simple and multiple linear regression using ordinary least squares. We will explore the assumptions underlying the linear model, discuss the consequences of violating these assumptions, and learn techniques to address these issues. Additionally, we will go beyond linear regression to cover more advanced econometric estimators.

In the final third of the course, we will transition to **machine learning**, a rapidly evolving field that is increasingly influencing econometrics and economics as a whole. We will begin by understanding the core principles and comparing them to traditional econometrics. The remainder of the course will be dedicated to learning some of the most prominent machine learning algorithms.

Moreover, you will gain proficiency in **R**, a powerful language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. R is widely used by economists and statisticians, and developing expertise in it will be a valuable asset for your resume and career prospects. I strongly encourage you to invest time in mastering R.

{{< youtube D2vj0WcvH5c >}}

**Youtube**:

    {{</* youtube w7Ft2ymGmfc */>}}

**Bilibili**:

    {{</* bilibili id="BV1WV4y1r7DF" */>}}

**Video file**

Videos may be added to a page by either placing them in your `assets/media/` media library or in your [page's folder](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/), and then embedding them with the _video_ shortcode:

    {{</* video src="my_video.mp4" controls="yes" */>}}

## Podcast

You can add a podcast or music to a page by placing the MP3 file in the page's folder or the media library folder and then embedding the audio on your page with the _audio_ shortcode:

    {{</* audio src="ambient-piano.mp3" */>}}

Try it out:

{{< audio src="ambient-piano.mp3" >}}

## Test students

Provide a simple yet fun self-assessment by revealing the solutions to challenges with the `spoiler` shortcode:

```markdown
{{</* spoiler text="👉 Click to view the solution" */>}}
You found me!
{{</* /spoiler */>}}
```

renders as

{{< spoiler text="👉 Click to view the solution" >}} You found me 🎉 {{< /spoiler >}}

## Math

Hugo Blox Builder supports a Markdown extension for $\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the `math` option in your `config/_default/params.yaml` file.

To render _inline_ or _block_ math, wrap your LaTeX math with `{{</* math */>}}$...${{</* /math */>}}` or `{{</* math */>}}$$...$${{</* /math */>}}`, respectively.

{{% callout note %}}
We wrap the LaTeX math in the Hugo Blox _math_ shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown.
{{% /callout %}}

Example **math block**:

```latex
{{</* math */>}}
$$
\gamma_{n} = \frac{ \left | \left (\mathbf x_{n} - \mathbf x_{n-1} \right )^T \left [\nabla F (\mathbf x_{n}) - \nabla F (\mathbf x_{n-1}) \right ] \right |}{\left \|\nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \right \|^2}
$$
{{</* /math */>}}
```

renders as

{{< math >}}
$$\gamma_{n} = \frac{ \left | \left (\mathbf x_{n} - \mathbf x_{n-1} \right )^T \left [\nabla F (\mathbf x_{n}) - \nabla F (\mathbf x_{n-1}) \right ] \right |}{\left \|\nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \right \|^2}$$
{{< /math >}}

Example **inline math** `{{</* math */>}}$\nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n})${{</* /math */>}}` renders as {{< math >}}$\nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n})${{< /math >}}.

Example **multi-line math** using the math linebreak (`\\`):

```latex
{{</* math */>}}
$$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} & \text{if }k=1, \\
1-p_{0}^{*} & \text{if }k=0.\end{cases}$$
{{</* /math */>}}
```

renders as

{{< math >}}

$$
f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} & \text{if }k=1, \\
1-p_{0}^{*} & \text{if }k=0.\end{cases}
$$

{{< /math >}}

## Code

Hugo Blox Builder utilises Hugo's Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. The code theme can be selected in the `config/_default/params.yaml` file.


    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
    data.head()
    ```

renders as

```python
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
data.head()
```

## Inline Images

```go
{{</* icon name="python" */>}} Python
```

renders as

{{< icon name="python" >}} Python
